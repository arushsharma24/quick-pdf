# Quick PDF

An app to quickly open a PDF file you usually use. Written in NativeScript

Got the idea to do this from my need to have to constantly open the ID card PDF file on my phone while scanning in and out of the campus gates. Now while only a few days remain, I will still use this as I thought of making it and, why not.
