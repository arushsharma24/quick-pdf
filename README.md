# Quick PDF

An app to quickly open a PDF file you usually use. Written in NativeScript

Got the idea to do this from my need to have to constantly open the ID card PDF file on my phone while scanning in and out of the campus gates. Now while only a few days remain, I will still use this as I thought of making it and, why not.

## Setup and Testing

To run, use the command ` ns run android `. This will start an emulator your emulator if you have used it previously, but if not, start your emulator once and then run the ` ns run android ` command. If the `ns run android ` command doesn't work, maybe try the ` ns build android `.
