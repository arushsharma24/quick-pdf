# Quick PDF

An app to quickly open a PDF file you usually use. Written in NativeScript

Got the idea to do this from my need to have to constantly open the ID card PDF file on my phone while scanning in and out of the campus gates. Now while only a few days remain, I will still use this as I thought of making it and, why not.

## Setup and Testing

To test, from the root directory run the command `npx react-native run-android` to test on android, while having a either an emulator running in the background (preferred), or a device connected via adb. 

On running this command, the app is built and then installed as an apk on the device, all the while Metro watches the file changes at each save of the file and allows us to do hot reloads.

## Current Status and Roadmap:
 - [x] Plain Android App
 - [x] App that shows a pdf
 - [ ] App where we can change the pdf
 - [ ] App with configuration options for the pdf
